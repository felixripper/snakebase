Notes:
- This PREVIEW lists only admin-related pages/components and the control-panel page.
- I will NOT delete wallet/auth, contracts, artifacts, typechain, or other on-chain related files unless you explicitly confirm.
- After you confirm, I'll delete these files, run `npm run build` on the branch and report any breakages.

Please confirm with one reply: "DELETE_ADMIN_NOW" to proceed, or "KEEP_AND_REVIEW" to adjust the list.
